# Forest-Type-Classification
### Description
This project aims to classify forest types using Sentinel-2 satellite data, facilitating the registration of community forest areas and contributing to carbon credit management. Given the challenges of on-ground forest surveys, remote sensing data from Sentinel-2 enables efficient data collection and analysis. The project leverages AI to analyze and classify forest types, essential for assessing carbon sequestration capabilities, which vary among different forest types.
